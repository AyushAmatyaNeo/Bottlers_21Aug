1
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,615
Mom!

2
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,743
Look at this, Mom!

3
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,829
And mine. Cool, isn't it?

4
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,043
Ed and Al...

5
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,795
I'm so proud.

6
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:31,466
Your alchemy skills have improved!

7
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,888
Will Daddy be impressed?

8
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,934
He'll be back one day
so you can show him.

9
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,312
Yippee!

10
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,023
Watch out, you two!

11
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:54,906
Mom?

12
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,957
Mom!

13
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,003
I'm hungry.

14
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:54,591
And cold.

15
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,305
I want to see Mom...

16
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,314
The alchemy book had something
about the Homunculi.

17
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,901
You mean artificial humans?

18
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,574
I wonder if we can bring Mom back.

19
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:24,246
But it's taboo for alchemists
to create humans.

20
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:30,502
We don't need to tell anyone.

21
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:42,556
<i>35 liters of water,
20 kilograms of carbon.</i>

22
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:47,144
<i>4 liters of ammonia,
1.5 kilograms of lime.</i>

23
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:51,440
<i>800 grams of phosphorus,
250 grams of salt.</i>

24
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,527
<i>100 grams of saltpeter,
80 grams of sulfur.</i>

25
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,448
<i>7.5 grams of fluorine, 5 grams of iron.</i>

26
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:04,286
<i>3 grams of silicon...
Plus 15 other chemicals.</i>

27
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,789
<i>Adult humans are made of...</i>

28
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,959
<i>readily available products.</i>

29
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:28,143
All in line with
the Law of Equivalent Exchange...

30
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,270
of alchemy.

31
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,732
We need one more thing.

32
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,526
The data of a human soul.

33
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,820
Is this really okay?

34
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:41,198
Don't say that now!

35
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,367
But in the alchemy book

36
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,827
it says it's taboo.

37
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,498
Don't you want to see Mom again?

38
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:50,749
I do...

39
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,459
Okay then!

40
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,630
Ready, Al?

41
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,509
Okay.

42
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,887
Something is wrong!

43
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,037
Al!

44
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:11,830
Ed!

45
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,374
Al!

46
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,084
Ed!

47
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,546
Ed!

48
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,590
Al!

49
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,675
Ed!

50
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,053
Ed, help!

51
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,097
Al!

52
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,377
Old man, just hand me that ring.

53
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,382
The Philosopher's Stone!

54
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,434
Give it up!

55
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,037
That's awesome!

56
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,456
The Stone does that?

57
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,295
It must be the real thing.

58
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:07,107
You can transmute without a circle!

59
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,278
You saved my ass!

60
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,220
You're hollow!

61
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,598
What are you two?

62
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,400
Hey.

63
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,068
That hurts.

64
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,946
Get off me!

65
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:46,874
That...

66
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,419
prosthetic arm...

67
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,716
and leg!

68
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,011
You're...

69
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:02,723
the Fullmetal Alchemist!

70
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:09,605
You mean you've heard of me?

71
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,570
Now hand it over.

72
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,947
The Philosopher's Stone!

73
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,148
How sneaky...

74
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,540
- His Holiness?
- His Holiness?

75
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,176
Don't you see?

76
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,347
The pastor doesn't perform miracles.

77
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:29,393
He conned everyone in town. He's a fake.

78
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,359
Stay away!

79
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,528
I'll kill her!

80
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,115
You third-grade alchemist!

81
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,702
I'll show you what separates us.

82
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,762
Huh?

83
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,139
Focus!

84
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,263
It's been a long time, Fullmetal.

85
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,182
Colonel!

86
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,891
The Flame Alchemist.

87
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:56,813
Arrest him!

88
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,615
What? Let me go!

89
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,785
I came to town for an inspection

90
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:14,414
when I heard a puny alchemist
was causing havoc.

91
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,167
Who are you calling puny?

92
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,085
Hey!

93
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:22,422
What in the hell have you made?

94
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:23,507
Let go!

95
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,844
I finally found the Stone.

96
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,906
The Philosopher's Stone is perfect
and indestructible...

97
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,741
Correct?

98
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,710
It's another fake...

99
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,170
Ed.

100
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,840
Sorry, Al.

101
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,220
You!

102
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,513
Halt!

103
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,356
- Take him to East Area Headquarters.
- Yes, sir!

104
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:26,862
Ed.

105
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,802
<i>Reole.</i>

106
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,473
<i>This is Reole.</i>

107
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,789
I know!

108
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,834
You're the famous Fullmetal Alchemist!

109
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,335
Of course!

110
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:26,171
You became a State-certified alchemist
at 12!

111
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,760
Did you get that name
'cause of the armor?

112
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,806
It's not me that you mean.

113
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,933
It's my brother.

114
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,269
You mean, the shorty?

115
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,354
Yes.

116
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,189
That's baloney!

117
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,152
It's true!

118
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:54,449
He can do alchemy
without a transmutation circle.

119
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,828
He might not be tall...

120
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,622
but my brother has a big heart.

121
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,792
Okay, you've made your point.

122
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:06,378
So, ask that shrimpy kid

123
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,632
to give me a shiny new marble stall.

124
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,886
Alchemy is not magic.

125
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:17,764
It's science. We can't do that...

126
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:20,309
Don't be stingy.

127
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,728
Like this!

128
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,231
The Law of Equivalent Exchange

129
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:30,319
applies to objects
when they're transmuted.

130
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:34,031
Conservation of mass, natural providence,

131
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,492
the four protyles and major elements...

132
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:39,494
Oops.

133
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,663
Okay.

134
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:46,168
To create something,
I need material of the same mass.

135
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,964
Water would be transmuted
into something similar.

136
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,843
Nothing you say makes sense,
but in short...

137
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:58,055
you can't make marble out of wood?

138
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,516
I'm sorry.

139
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,519
Al!

140
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,192
Winry!

141
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:16,698
It's been ages.

142
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,201
Hey.

143
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,369
Where's Ed?

144
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,511
I'll find the Stone!

145
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:39,763
Give up!

146
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:42,224
It's only a myth.

147
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,102
What about that stone?

148
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,271
It had powers.

149
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,231
Like I said...

150
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,942
it was an amplifier.

151
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:55,612
We're developing a similar stone.

152
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,030
But...

153
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,198
it doesn't amplify much.

154
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,451
The power to transmute a human

155
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,955
would be in the tens of thousands!

156
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:07,583
Besides...

157
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,086
the Military says there's no Stone.

158
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:13,755
They're clueless!

159
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,256
What's that?

160
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:19,928
A State Alchemist can't be subversive!

161
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:24,766
I need the Philosopher's Stone.

162
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,769
So Al can get back his body.

163
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:34,526
That's why I slave away
as a State Alchemist.

164
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,322
To access the secret of the Stone.

165
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:42,242
And to get your limbs back.

166
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:47,289
I'm not doing it for me!

167
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,625
Al's my priority.

168
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,463
I want to get his body back.

169
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,509
And for that,

170
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:02,137
you would destroy a town?

171
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,476
For Al's sake...

172
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,689
I'd do anything.

173
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:25,494
You must obey the State Military.

174
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,665
Find another way.

175
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:33,502
Forget about the Philosopher's Stone.

176
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:37,965
Can I come in?

177
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:39,675
Hey!

178
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,343
Captain Hughes!

179
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,721
Looking good, Ed.

180
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,355
General Hakuro.

181
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,031
Here you are...

182
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,701
Fullmetal Alchemist.

183
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:12,416
Finally we meet!

184
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,543
You did some demolishing?

185
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:18,881
And...

186
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:23,093
I heard you have a brother...
In armor.

187
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:26,722
He's fixing up the town that I wrecked.

188
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,558
Picking up after you!

189
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,396
I'd love to meet your armored brother!

190
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,899
And hear about your adventures.

191
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:39,318
Sure!

192
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:44,740
"A State Alchemist can't be subversive!"

193
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:48,285
He acts so superior...

194
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:51,455
The Colonel gets more and more obnoxious.

195
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,749
Well, he did get a promotion.

196
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,793
I guess he has what it takes.

197
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:59,880
And you don't, Captain?

198
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:01,131
Hey!

199
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:02,424
Watch it.

200
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:05,636
Why are you at East Area HQ?

201
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,763
Not for a demotion!

202
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:12,017
I came for an inspection.

203
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,270
I'm beat! I just came from Central City.

204
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,149
Ed!

205
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:23,695
Winry?

206
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:29,117
Whoa, whoa...

207
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:36,291
What did you do to it?

208
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:42,005
<i>You know what I put into this
first-rate automail arm?</i>

209
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:42,965
Sorry.

210
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:45,509
What did you do to it?

211
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:48,345
Let's see, I fought stone beasts...

212
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:53,392
It's beyond repair.
I'll have to make it from scratch!

213
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,105
Captain Hughes came from Central
on short notice.

214
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:02,150
For an inspection?

215
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:04,027
At this time?

216
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:05,654
That's right.

217
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:10,325
Could he have a hidden agenda?

218
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,494
Do you know something?

219
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:14,329
No, sir.

220
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:20,002
The Führer works in mysterious ways.

221
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:29,178
You're a brilliant officer.

222
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,015
Don't let people

223
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,350
walk all over you.

224
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:43,984
You know Shou Tucker?

225
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,361
Yes.

226
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:50,699
The State Alchemist
who transmutes chimeras.

227
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,578
Can you introduce the brothers to Tucker?

228
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:57,206
Ed and Al, sir?

229
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:01,543
I want to do something for those boys.

230
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:04,046
Yes, sir.

231
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,890
Don't be hasty! Please!

232
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:17,726
I have influence in town.

233
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:30,656
Listen!

234
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:34,952
I messed up because
your Philosopher's Stone

235
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,411
was a fake!

236
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:38,747
A fake?

237
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:42,751
Do you think there's a real one?

238
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,631
If not, there can't be a fake one.

239
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,091
Right, Envy?

240
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:17,286
Oh, no.

241
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,621
The real one's gone.

242
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:25,836
Then I can't be accused
of being a fake either.

243
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:30,174
Please, Lust...

244
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:32,176
Can I eat this?

245
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:36,471
No, Gluttony.

246
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:38,807
If you eat him...

247
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:40,809
you'll get an upset tummy.

248
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:02,581
Can we really stay here tonight, Gracia?

249
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:05,501
Sure. The more the merrier.

250
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:08,837
This huge house is ours for a month.

251
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,717
The State Military sure spoils captains!

252
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,843
Ed!

253
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:16,220
Oh, God...

254
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:21,308
Is it hard being his mechanic, Winry?

255
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:25,395
It's terrible!
Only Ed breaks my automails.

256
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,397
Not on purpose...

257
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,399
Don't break it again.

258
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:32,236
It makes my work look shoddy.

259
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,738
Stop complaining, will you?

260
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,865
Don't talk back!

261
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,826
She's worried about you.

262
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:46,041
She knew from the damaged arm
that you were in danger.

263
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,878
No! I don't worry about him...

264
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:57,386
You three grew up together?

265
00:27:58,428 --> 00:27:59,263
Right.

266
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:01,223
We were born in Resenbool.

267
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:05,227
We grew up together like siblings.

268
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:11,275
By the way, how did you two meet?

269
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:13,318
- You wanna know?
- Yes!

270
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:16,738
Great! Where do I begin?

271
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:21,535
Once he starts, he won't stop.
I'll get seconds.

272
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:24,079
Don't get up. I'll do it.

273
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:26,081
Mom-to-be!

274
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,866
Al?

275
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:17,007
Ed!

276
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,092
Al!

277
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,314
Huh?

278
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:35,651
What was I doing?

279
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:03,303
<i>You!</i>

280
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:15,983
Who are you?

281
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:21,071
<i>I am what you call the world.</i>

282
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:24,283
<i>The universe.</i>

283
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,159
<i>God.</i>

284
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:28,662
<i>Truth.</i>

285
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:31,039
<i>One...</i>

286
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:33,458
<i>and all.</i>

287
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:36,503
<i>I am also...</i>

288
00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:38,881
<i>you.</i>

289
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,050
<i>Here's what you wanted.</i>

290
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:45,137
<i>The truth.</i>

291
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:10,954
<i>My head hurts.</i>

292
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:12,873
<i>Don't destroy me.</i>

293
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:14,124
<i>No!</i>

294
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:16,627
<i>Please don't!</i>

295
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:27,804
<i>Mom.</i>

296
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,935
<i>Mom!</i>

297
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:46,281
<i>Well?</i>

298
00:31:52,955 --> 00:31:54,957
I understand now.

299
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:01,630
The truth.

300
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:07,886
I knew my theory was right.

301
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:13,600
I was so close to the truth
of Human Transmutation!

302
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:18,564
Please let me see it once more.

303
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:20,983
<i>Sorry, you can't.</i>

304
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:26,071
<i>You only have enough toll...</i>

305
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:28,407
<i>to see that much.</i>

306
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:30,284
Toll?

307
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:32,327
<i>That's right.</i>

308
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:37,791
<i>Toll.</i>

309
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:42,171
What?

310
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:45,841
<i>Equivalent exchange.</i>

311
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,553
<i>Right?</i>

312
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:52,472
<i>Alchemist.</i>

313
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:07,529
Al?

314
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:10,157
Al!

315
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:16,455
Damn it, he took my leg!

316
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:19,041
Somebody help me...

317
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,588
Mom...

318
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:33,347
Mom?

319
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:01,375
No...

320
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,713
This isn't what I wanted.

321
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:11,176
Al...

322
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,889
It's my fault.

323
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:24,398
Give back...

324
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:28,777
my brother.

325
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:35,576
Take my legs, arms, or heart!

326
00:34:38,704 --> 00:34:40,163
But give him back...

327
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:46,253
He's the only family I have!

328
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:53,427
<i>You're foolish...</i>

329
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:55,596
<i>to return.</i>

330
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:11,153
Not again...

331
00:35:12,738 --> 00:35:14,615
The same nightmare?

332
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:23,957
It's always a reenactment...

333
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:28,670
of that day.

334
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,266
The Sewing-Life Alchemist?

335
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,434
That's right.

336
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,686
His name is Shou Tucker.

337
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:48,148
A pioneer in biological alchemy.

338
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:54,863
He's researching how
to transmute speaking chimeras.

339
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:56,823
Speaking chimeras!

340
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:58,408
I want to see!

341
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:01,662
He transmuted one two years ago.

342
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:03,497
It spoke three words.

343
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:06,166
"Let me die."

344
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:11,338
Who thinks we should meet him?

345
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:13,090
General Hakuro.

346
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:17,177
He thinks it might help you
with your quest.

347
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:25,352
What a huge house!

348
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:28,564
Ed!

349
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:29,773
You okay?

350
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:35,237
We have a lot of visitors, Dad!

351
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:37,739
Alexander, no!

352
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:49,209
Sorry about the mess.

353
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:53,714
It's been pretty much like this
since my wife left.

354
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:55,716
Is this a bad time?

355
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:57,050
Not at all.

356
00:36:57,426 --> 00:37:02,556
It's a privilege to meet the famous
Fullmetal Alchemist.

357
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:08,562
General Hakuro sent you here
so you're my priority.

358
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:09,479
Here.

359
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:10,898
Thank you.

360
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:12,733
Al, this way!

361
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:16,820
- Here.
- Where?

362
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:18,155
Here?

363
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:19,656
- He's coming!
- Wait!

364
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:24,620
Nina is happy to have someone
to play with.

365
00:37:26,205 --> 00:37:29,333
I have no time for her these days.

366
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:33,253
Is your evaluation soon?

367
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:36,757
Yes. The annual review...

368
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,426
Proving my worth to HQ...

369
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:41,595
causes me stress.

370
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:46,934
I'm no genius like you.

371
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:51,313
This time...

372
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:54,191
I might lose my job.

373
00:37:56,902 --> 00:37:59,613
I can't let that happen.

374
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:13,627
You want to know why I'm here?

375
00:38:14,086 --> 00:38:16,463
To be honest, yes.

376
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:22,135
The Ishvalan Civil War...

377
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:24,805
left things in disarray.

378
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:28,141
All the riots and upheaval...

379
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:31,478
The East Area is no exception.

380
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:34,731
Am I under suspicion?

381
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:36,650
I don't doubt you.

382
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:38,819
But as for the top brass...

383
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:42,322
They aren't so sure.

384
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:47,828
So, they sent a friend to watch me?

385
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:53,333
Roy.

386
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:56,503
You want to make it to the top?

387
00:38:58,213 --> 00:39:00,007
Watch your back.

388
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:03,010
The Military has its detractors.

389
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:09,016
Should I watch you?

390
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:14,188
Yes.

391
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:35,918
Whoa...

392
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:42,216
My work with chimeras
is seen as pioneering,

393
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:43,550
but really...

394
00:39:43,926 --> 00:39:46,220
most of them are imperfect.

395
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:54,144
But you did create a chimera that speaks.

396
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:57,773
Yes, just once, two years ago.

397
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:02,277
So, you actually did it.
That's impressive!

398
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:04,738
But...

399
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:09,243
it only spoke three words and died.

400
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:14,248
But that's how I qualified
as a State Alchemist.

401
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:21,171
So, your mom's not around...

402
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,926
Yep, but it's okay.
I have Dad and Alexander.

403
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:28,428
But...

404
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:33,308
Dad spends all his time in the lab lately.

405
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:36,436
I'm by myself a lot.

406
00:40:39,565 --> 00:40:40,607
Well, then...

407
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:43,569
let's spend the day playing together!

408
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:45,612
- Really?
- Yes!

409
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:48,448
Isn't that great, Alexander?

410
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:50,826
Good boy!

411
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:58,292
I went back...

412
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:02,004
to the Gate of Truth...

413
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:05,632
but all I could get back was Al's soul.

414
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:11,471
So, you transmuted Al's soul...

415
00:41:12,014 --> 00:41:15,309
<i>and embedded it in steel armor...</i>

416
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:20,898
My right arm was taken for Al's soul.

417
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:23,859
I would've...

418
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:29,156
given my life...

419
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:32,993
to get Al's body back.

420
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,332
How devastating...

421
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:42,336
Mr. Tucker.

422
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:46,340
How can I get Al's body back?

423
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:50,177
Well...

424
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,014
It's not within my power.

425
00:41:56,475 --> 00:41:59,353
Right. I thought so.

426
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:05,692
But...

427
00:42:09,655 --> 00:42:11,698
I want to try something.

428
00:42:18,497 --> 00:42:20,707
Hey, Ed!

429
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:29,800
- Phew!
- Sorry we left in a hurry.

430
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:33,387
It's okay. I was held up with paperwork.

431
00:42:33,846 --> 00:42:35,722
This is from my wife.

432
00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:38,517
Oh, thank you!

433
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:42,312
Hey, where is Al?

434
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:46,066
Al will stay at Tucker's house...

435
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:48,735
and be examined.

436
00:42:49,194 --> 00:42:50,070
Good.

437
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:53,407
Did Tucker have information for you?

438
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:58,787
Yes, about a Stone researcher
named Doctor Marcoh.

439
00:42:58,871 --> 00:43:02,583
He's been missing for a year,

440
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:04,918
but he was seen in Barns.

441
00:43:08,797 --> 00:43:12,259
I hope you find the Philosopher's Stone.

442
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:21,435
My research was second-rate last year.

443
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:26,356
If I fail this year...

444
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,067
I might lose my job.

445
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:31,945
You'll be okay, Dad.

446
00:43:32,029 --> 00:43:35,449
Because you always study so hard.

447
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,749
I love you, Dad.

448
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:48,462
Daddy...

449
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:52,299
will pull it off.

450
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:13,529
Are you worried?

451
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:19,034
Don't worry. Al's not a kid anymore.

452
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,204
I'm not worried.

453
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:23,664
I just...

454
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:25,749
miss him.

455
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:29,378
Yeah, you're always together.

456
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:34,132
But he has Tucker, Nina, and Alexander.

457
00:44:34,216 --> 00:44:36,051
Yeah, don't worry.

458
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:41,056
By the way,
I noticed you were Nina's favorite.

459
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:42,975
Ed, catch!

460
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:48,480
Ed, come and play with me!

461
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:53,902
Yeah, little kids like me.

462
00:44:53,986 --> 00:44:55,153
'Cause you're tiny.

463
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:03,787
Hey, it's an apple pie!

464
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,415
- You're eating it now?
- Why not?

465
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:09,835
Gracia baked it for us to eat!

466
00:45:09,918 --> 00:45:11,044
Have a bite.

467
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:19,928
Al...

468
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:22,764
He can't eat pies...

469
00:45:27,603 --> 00:45:29,146
He can't sleep.

470
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,607
He's numb to pain...

471
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:38,822
But remember what Tucker said.

472
00:45:38,906 --> 00:45:40,574
He'll hypnotize Al

473
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:44,494
so he can learn more about him.

474
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:48,207
Al might be dreaming now.

475
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:52,002
You're right.

476
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:55,589
And eating a huge apple pie
in his dream!

477
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:58,800
He's big, so it would have to be large.

478
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,013
That's weird. It would be wide!

479
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:05,182
You think so?

480
00:46:05,807 --> 00:46:08,477
More? Have a tiny slice.

481
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:10,270
Hey!

482
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:29,665
I feel hot all over...

483
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:34,920
Maybe your soul is rejoining your body...

484
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:37,172
Or...

485
00:46:38,674 --> 00:46:39,967
Yes?

486
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:42,511
Or maybe...

487
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:47,599
you're losing your false memories.

488
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,603
False memories?

489
00:46:52,437 --> 00:46:54,314
Not your soul.

490
00:46:54,565 --> 00:46:59,570
Many alchemists successfully
implanted false memories.

491
00:47:00,153 --> 00:47:03,407
You mean, my memories are made up?

492
00:47:04,575 --> 00:47:07,995
It's a natural assumption...

493
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:13,083
but you might be an exception.

494
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:15,669
I feel dizzy...

495
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:20,424
False memories...

496
00:47:32,644 --> 00:47:33,687
What?

497
00:47:34,646 --> 00:47:35,522
Get up!

498
00:47:35,606 --> 00:47:36,690
What?

499
00:47:36,773 --> 00:47:37,774
Winry!

500
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:38,901
Your bag!

501
00:47:41,778 --> 00:47:44,239
But we're not in Barns yet...

502
00:47:44,323 --> 00:47:45,699
- Show me!
- What?

503
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:47,659
The photo Tucker gave you!

504
00:47:50,787 --> 00:47:51,663
Here.

505
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:56,043
It's him.

506
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:58,879
Doctor Marcoh!

507
00:47:58,962 --> 00:48:00,255
Winry!

508
00:48:01,882 --> 00:48:03,717
Wait up, Winry.

509
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:09,515
Hi, excuse me!

510
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:14,561
Did you see this man just now?

511
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:15,896
No.

512
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:21,735
Just a minute.

513
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:24,112
Can I see that again?

514
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:25,322
Sure.

515
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:31,745
It's Dr. Mauro from the hospital
over there.

516
00:48:31,828 --> 00:48:35,249
He looks older than this.

517
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:03,277
Hello?

518
00:49:09,741 --> 00:49:11,618
Is Dr. Marcoh here?

519
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:22,838
What do you want?

520
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,800
Why do you know that name?

521
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,971
Calm down, Dr. Marcoh.

522
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:33,724
I'm never going back.

523
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,660
Sorry about that.

524
00:49:56,496 --> 00:50:00,042
I thought they'd come to take me back.

525
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:02,044
They?

526
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:11,553
You helped the Military
research the Stone...

527
00:50:13,305 --> 00:50:15,015
Is that somehow related?

528
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:23,065
Never mind the Military's schemes.

529
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:26,527
But please.

530
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:29,738
Tell me this.

531
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:35,160
Does the Philosopher's Stone exist?

532
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,840
You should go.

533
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:49,758
Sorry?

534
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:54,805
You transmuted before, without a circle.

535
00:50:56,515 --> 00:50:58,851
Did you transmute a human?

536
00:51:00,227 --> 00:51:02,604
And open the Gate of Truth...

537
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:05,941
That's why I'm looking for the Stone.

538
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:08,777
Listen to me.

539
00:51:09,486 --> 00:51:12,072
Stay away from the Stone for your sake.

540
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:18,036
I need it even if it costs my life!

541
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:22,583
Play with the devil
and you'll end up in hell.

542
00:51:25,419 --> 00:51:27,796
I've already been to hell!

543
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:50,319
How cruel...

544
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:52,738
I lost a life.

545
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:09,129
What is she?

546
00:52:11,924 --> 00:52:14,343
It's been a long time, Marcoh.

547
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:18,347
So, you've been hiding here.

548
00:52:19,473 --> 00:52:20,682
Lust.

549
00:52:21,475 --> 00:52:22,976
I won't go back.

550
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:25,687
You won't have to.

551
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:28,690
You're no longer needed.

552
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:35,739
You!

553
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:36,740
Too slow.

554
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:39,451
Ed!

555
00:52:40,118 --> 00:52:41,411
Winry!

556
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:43,080
Winry!

557
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:46,500
Stop squeaking...

558
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:48,877
Fullmetal boy.

559
00:52:49,628 --> 00:52:51,547
Be quiet...

560
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,049
and I'll let you live.

561
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:57,886
You'll make a fine sacrifice.

562
00:53:03,517 --> 00:53:06,061
But you're worthless.

563
00:53:08,647 --> 00:53:09,481
Don't!

564
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:40,637
I'm okay.

565
00:53:42,556 --> 00:53:43,432
Dr. Marcoh!

566
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:48,478
Keep this.

567
00:53:53,609 --> 00:53:55,194
The Philosopher's Stone...

568
00:53:59,114 --> 00:54:00,782
To transmute...

569
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:02,993
the Stone.

570
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:08,957
Did you transmute the Stone?

571
00:54:11,585 --> 00:54:13,295
Laboratory...

572
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:18,383
Number 5.

573
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:20,886
Lab Number 5...

574
00:54:24,473 --> 00:54:25,641
Dr. Marcoh?

575
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:27,309
Doctor?

576
00:54:46,662 --> 00:54:47,955
<i>It's okay.</i>

577
00:54:48,038 --> 00:54:50,123
I'll deal with the mess.

578
00:54:50,415 --> 00:54:51,500
But...

579
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:55,128
I'll ask the Military Police for help.

580
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:00,884
Hurry. You finally have a crucial clue.

581
00:55:04,513 --> 00:55:07,683
Go and make sure Al is okay.

582
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:34,042
The Philosopher's Stone...

583
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:36,879
It exists!

584
00:55:48,098 --> 00:55:49,224
Mr. Tucker!

585
00:55:57,232 --> 00:55:58,317
Mr. Tucker?

586
00:56:00,402 --> 00:56:01,236
Huh?

587
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:05,240
Al?

588
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:09,411
Nina?

589
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,805
Hey, you're back.

590
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,433
I just got back now.

591
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:35,270
I want to consult you about something...

592
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:41,443
Where's Al?

593
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:45,113
I think he'll wake up soon.

594
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,158
Look at this.

595
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:49,781
I succeeded!

596
00:56:51,787 --> 00:56:54,122
A chimera that communicates.

597
00:56:59,628 --> 00:57:00,796
Listen.

598
00:57:01,463 --> 00:57:02,965
That boy is...

599
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:04,800
Edward.

600
00:57:07,386 --> 00:57:08,303
Ed...

601
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:09,805
...ward.

602
00:57:10,848 --> 00:57:11,682
Yes.

603
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:13,642
Very good.

604
00:57:17,437 --> 00:57:20,482
Incredible! It really speaks.

605
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:21,984
Yes.

606
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:26,071
Just in time for the evaluation.

607
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:31,159
Finally...

608
00:57:31,952 --> 00:57:36,290
the Military will recognize my talent.

609
00:57:37,332 --> 00:57:38,834
Edward.

610
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,086
Edward!

611
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:44,798
Ed, come and play with me!

612
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,516
Mr. Tucker.

613
00:57:59,479 --> 00:58:00,522
Yes?

614
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:05,485
When did your chimera research...

615
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:09,072
first qualify you as a State Alchemist?

616
00:58:10,741 --> 00:58:12,284
Let's see...

617
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:14,578
Two years ago.

618
00:58:16,538 --> 00:58:18,540
When did your wife leave?

619
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:25,881
Two years ago.

620
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:30,219
I have another question.

621
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,725
Nina and Alexander...

622
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,565
Where are they?

623
00:58:47,486 --> 00:58:50,822
I hate insightful brats like you.

624
00:58:51,573 --> 00:58:52,699
You!

625
00:58:59,581 --> 00:59:01,917
Two years ago it was your wife.

626
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:06,964
Now you used your daughter and dog
for your chimera!

627
00:59:09,675 --> 00:59:13,387
I see! It's harder with animals.

628
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:17,015
So, you ended up using humans!

629
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,101
Why are you upset?

630
00:59:19,518 --> 00:59:23,188
Human experiments gave us progress.

631
00:59:23,939 --> 00:59:26,275
You won't get away with this!

632
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:27,693
You...

633
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:31,196
How dare you toy with human lives?

634
00:59:32,531 --> 00:59:34,449
Human lives...

635
00:59:35,117 --> 00:59:36,451
Yes.

636
00:59:36,743 --> 00:59:39,162
Like your limbs and Al's body.

637
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:43,625
You gave them up
when you toyed with human life.

638
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:45,627
We're the same.

639
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:47,504
You and I.

640
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:49,339
No!

641
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:59,933
Nothing separates us, Fullmetal Alchemist!

642
01:00:00,017 --> 01:00:01,059
Wrong!

643
01:00:01,643 --> 01:00:03,061
No!

644
01:00:03,145 --> 01:00:05,480
You're wrong!

645
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,149
- No!
- Ed!

646
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:17,868
You'll kill him if you keep that up...

647
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:29,379
Sometimes you get your hands dirty.

648
01:00:29,463 --> 01:00:30,797
Mr. Tucker.

649
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:36,845
Shut up
or I'll be the one to lose control.

650
01:00:38,347 --> 01:00:39,348
Da...

651
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:43,435
Dad...

652
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:57,324
Nina.

653
01:00:57,866 --> 01:00:59,284
I'm sorry.

654
01:01:00,202 --> 01:01:05,707
We're not capable
of turning you back yet...

655
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:09,169
I...

656
01:01:10,254 --> 01:01:12,631
don't know who to trust.

657
01:01:16,218 --> 01:01:17,427
I'm sorry.

658
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:20,514
Play...

659
01:01:21,014 --> 01:01:22,266
with me.

660
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:24,810
Play with me.

661
01:01:51,753 --> 01:01:54,089
Your credentials are revoked...

662
01:01:54,506 --> 01:01:56,758
and you'll be court-martialed.

663
01:01:57,801 --> 01:01:59,136
Take him away.

664
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:09,771
Will they be okay?

665
01:02:17,404 --> 01:02:18,614
Alphonse!

666
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:21,617
We're close to the truth!

667
01:02:22,117 --> 01:02:23,619
See you again!

668
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:38,967
How long are you going to be miserable?

669
01:02:42,137 --> 01:02:43,305
Leave me alone.

670
01:02:45,807 --> 01:02:49,144
You chose to be a State Alchemist,
a devil...

671
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:53,857
to find a way to get back your limbs
and Al's body.

672
01:02:55,275 --> 01:02:56,818
Don't be put off.

673
01:02:57,861 --> 01:02:59,821
It's a small thing.

674
01:03:03,325 --> 01:03:04,826
Small thing...

675
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:11,041
You're right.

676
01:03:13,085 --> 01:03:15,671
Let them call me a devil.

677
01:03:16,088 --> 01:03:17,297
Al and I...

678
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:20,175
We'll get our bodies back.

679
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:27,850
But...

680
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:34,690
the thing is we're not devils,
let alone gods.

681
01:03:46,451 --> 01:03:48,203
We're humans...

682
01:03:55,752 --> 01:03:58,505
who can't even save a girl!

683
01:04:04,845 --> 01:04:06,889
We're powerless...

684
01:04:16,565 --> 01:04:18,025
You'll get a cold.

685
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:20,569
Go and rest.

686
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:51,850
<i>For three days Ed's locked himself
in the library.</i>

687
01:04:53,185 --> 01:04:55,270
He's hardly eaten.

688
01:04:56,605 --> 01:04:57,940
Right...

689
01:04:59,274 --> 01:05:01,401
He won't let me help him.

690
01:05:01,485 --> 01:05:04,446
He says that it's dangerous.

691
01:05:11,495 --> 01:05:13,705
What did you two find out?

692
01:05:43,193 --> 01:05:45,988
You're all locked up in this dungeon...

693
01:05:46,071 --> 01:05:47,406
Captain...

694
01:05:48,824 --> 01:05:50,909
So, did you find it?

695
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:56,915
Don't do it alone.

696
01:05:57,332 --> 01:05:59,001
Aren't we friends?

697
01:06:01,295 --> 01:06:03,005
Aren't we?

698
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,341
Sure we are.

699
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:10,592
Friends help each other.

700
01:06:13,557 --> 01:06:14,975
May I present...

701
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:20,480
Lieutenant Ross and sandwiches!

702
01:06:24,693 --> 01:06:27,154
Eat or you'll collapse.

703
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:30,199
No offence...

704
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,614
but she works for the Colonel.

705
01:06:32,826 --> 01:06:36,538
She's an elite officer and my good friend.

706
01:06:36,955 --> 01:06:39,041
My friend is your friend.

707
01:06:42,044 --> 01:06:44,880
- A friend's friend...
- Enough!

708
01:06:46,715 --> 01:06:47,966
Eat up...

709
01:06:48,342 --> 01:06:52,638
so we can talk about Lab Number 5
and the Stone.

710
01:06:55,974 --> 01:06:58,769
I told Winry to keep it quiet!

711
01:06:58,852 --> 01:07:02,231
Don't blame her. I'm very persuasive.

712
01:07:07,986 --> 01:07:08,904
But...

713
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:13,075
I'm closing in on a military secret.

714
01:07:18,956 --> 01:07:21,083
Marcoh was assassinated.

715
01:07:22,042 --> 01:07:23,293
It's very risky...

716
01:07:23,377 --> 01:07:25,003
Like I said...

717
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:29,633
You and I...

718
01:07:30,425 --> 01:07:31,385
are friends.

719
01:07:47,985 --> 01:07:49,403
Ed's right.

720
01:07:49,653 --> 01:07:53,407
No record of the Stone's
transmutation circle.

721
01:07:54,449 --> 01:07:58,245
And Marcoh's documents aren't here either.

722
01:08:01,206 --> 01:08:02,416
Yes...

723
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,669
Someone took them. But why?

724
01:08:07,462 --> 01:08:10,507
It must be an inside job.

725
01:08:12,467 --> 01:08:14,428
It's got to be.

726
01:08:17,055 --> 01:08:19,099
The Military, the Stone...

727
01:08:19,725 --> 01:08:22,311
And the tattooed woman.

728
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:25,272
She's not a human.

729
01:08:26,565 --> 01:08:28,859
I don't think she can be.

730
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:34,740
How about Lab Number 5?

731
01:08:37,826 --> 01:08:40,787
Marcoh worked in Lab Number 3.

732
01:08:41,246 --> 01:08:44,333
There were only four labs.

733
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:47,586
There's no record of Lab Number 5.

734
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:50,839
But Marcoh said Lab Number 5!

735
01:08:53,967 --> 01:08:56,011
- A meeting?
- General!

736
01:08:57,429 --> 01:08:59,389
With Captain Hughes?

737
01:08:59,473 --> 01:09:01,308
I... well...

738
01:09:01,391 --> 01:09:02,643
I know.

739
01:09:02,935 --> 01:09:05,896
It was dubbed that by some people.

740
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:06,813
Sir?

741
01:09:07,606 --> 01:09:10,025
I'm talking about Lab Number 5.

742
01:09:10,317 --> 01:09:11,652
Where is it?

743
01:09:12,444 --> 01:09:14,655
I wasn't here when it existed but...

744
01:09:16,406 --> 01:09:17,741
This one, I guess.

745
01:09:19,785 --> 01:09:21,203
It's a cannery.

746
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:25,999
Why did they call it Lab Number 5?

747
01:09:27,251 --> 01:09:30,379
The cannery is no longer in operation.

748
01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:35,342
Thank you, General!

749
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:36,844
Ed!

750
01:09:37,636 --> 01:09:39,096
General!

751
01:09:40,097 --> 01:09:42,516
Riots are underway in Reole.

752
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,311
Reole? Where the fake pastor was.

753
01:09:46,812 --> 01:09:49,022
There are casualties.

754
01:09:49,398 --> 01:09:50,649
I'm on my way.

755
01:09:50,983 --> 01:09:53,694
- Back to your station.
- Yes, sir.

756
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:56,488
- You're our guest.
- But...

757
01:09:56,572 --> 01:09:58,115
I'll go.

758
01:09:58,407 --> 01:10:02,703
Colonel Mustang will be in charge.
Stay and help him.

759
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:10,043
There's been too much bloodshed
in this country.

760
01:10:10,794 --> 01:10:14,006
It's Reole this time.

761
01:10:56,298 --> 01:10:58,008
This is the last room...

762
01:10:59,176 --> 01:11:01,678
There's no sign of a laboratory.

763
01:11:11,313 --> 01:11:12,773
Damn it!

764
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:17,402
Damn it!

765
01:11:25,661 --> 01:11:28,455
We were so close to the Stone's secret!

766
01:11:43,178 --> 01:11:44,596
Cheer up, Al.

767
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:46,932
We'll get there.

768
01:11:48,267 --> 01:11:52,187
- We'll get your body...
- What did Marcoh tell you?

769
01:11:53,689 --> 01:11:54,690
Al...

770
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:59,027
Why won't you tell me?

771
01:11:59,111 --> 01:12:00,612
'Cause...

772
01:12:05,993 --> 01:12:09,079
We don't know if my body
actually exists.

773
01:12:09,162 --> 01:12:13,000
How can you be sure
that we'll get it back?

774
01:12:14,668 --> 01:12:17,504
You say you transmuted my soul.

775
01:12:18,046 --> 01:12:22,509
Perhaps you just gave me a false memory.

776
01:12:23,969 --> 01:12:25,554
What's wrong?

777
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:28,348
Embedding a transmuted soul

778
01:12:28,432 --> 01:12:31,185
can't be done, according to Tucker.

779
01:12:31,268 --> 01:12:34,688
He said you were too young to pull it off.

780
01:12:34,771 --> 01:12:36,857
Tucker, that creep...

781
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:42,029
Whatever Tucker told you isn't true, okay?

782
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,325
Trust me.

783
01:12:47,659 --> 01:12:49,703
Trust you?

784
01:12:50,412 --> 01:12:53,874
How can I trust anything? I'm hollow!

785
01:12:57,169 --> 01:12:59,546
Maybe I never existed.

786
01:13:00,881 --> 01:13:01,715
Al...

787
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:04,343
Maybe everything is made up!

788
01:13:07,638 --> 01:13:09,890
I know you're all deceiving me.

789
01:13:11,642 --> 01:13:13,393
You're a liar!

790
01:13:13,477 --> 01:13:14,311
Ed!

791
01:13:18,106 --> 01:13:19,066
I bet...

792
01:13:20,526 --> 01:13:22,819
you're not even my brother!

793
01:13:57,813 --> 01:13:59,857
What are you doing?

794
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,692
Stop it, you two!

795
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:21,086
Use your right hand.

796
01:14:23,505 --> 01:14:25,924
You'll injure your left hand.

797
01:15:03,128 --> 01:15:04,838
You hopeless idiot!

798
01:15:08,509 --> 01:15:12,262
You have no idea
how much Ed cares about you!

799
01:15:15,307 --> 01:15:16,850
Ed is...

800
01:15:17,434 --> 01:15:19,895
He's always thinking about you.

801
01:15:22,898 --> 01:15:25,234
When he's with me...

802
01:15:26,193 --> 01:15:29,029
all he does is talk about you.

803
01:15:30,572 --> 01:15:31,615
Winry...

804
01:15:36,828 --> 01:15:38,247
He thinks...

805
01:15:38,997 --> 01:15:42,334
it's his fault that you lost your body.

806
01:15:43,168 --> 01:15:45,379
He blames himself.

807
01:15:47,339 --> 01:15:49,550
He wants to get your body back...

808
01:15:49,925 --> 01:15:52,636
as soon as possible.

809
01:15:53,595 --> 01:15:55,764
So, he does crazy things.

810
01:15:59,768 --> 01:16:00,894
Tell me.

811
01:16:02,688 --> 01:16:05,065
What idiot would risk his life...

812
01:16:05,524 --> 01:16:09,111
to create a fake brother?

813
01:16:17,369 --> 01:16:19,079
You're brothers.

814
01:16:20,038 --> 01:16:22,749
You only have each other!

815
01:16:40,559 --> 01:16:41,476
Al.

816
01:16:41,727 --> 01:16:43,270
I'm not done!

817
01:16:54,281 --> 01:16:55,324
Ed.

818
01:16:55,991 --> 01:16:57,159
It hurts.

819
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:02,497
You don't feel pain!

820
01:17:09,755 --> 01:17:10,797
Ed.

821
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:12,799
I do.

822
01:17:14,176 --> 01:17:15,969
It does hurt.

823
01:17:35,822 --> 01:17:37,491
I promise.

824
01:17:39,117 --> 01:17:41,495
I'll get your body back.

825
01:17:47,251 --> 01:17:48,836
Trust me.

826
01:18:07,229 --> 01:18:09,231
The Ishvalan Civil War.

827
01:18:11,859 --> 01:18:13,360
Riots in Reole...

828
01:18:14,778 --> 01:18:17,948
Upheaval in the north and south...

829
01:18:27,249 --> 01:18:31,211
Oh, my God, who is behind it?

830
01:18:33,547 --> 01:18:34,798
Wait a minute...

831
01:18:52,149 --> 01:18:53,859
Just as I thought.

832
01:18:54,526 --> 01:18:57,487
The position of the four labs
is significant.

833
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:00,991
Lab Number 5 must be located...

834
01:19:16,215 --> 01:19:17,424
Here!

835
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:22,763
Now you know too much.

836
01:19:35,442 --> 01:19:37,277
The Ouroboros tattoo!

837
01:19:38,529 --> 01:19:39,613
It's you.

838
01:19:40,155 --> 01:19:42,824
You assassinated Marcoh.

839
01:19:46,537 --> 01:19:48,038
Nice to meet you.

840
01:19:50,541 --> 01:19:53,126
Or is "Goodbye" more appropriate?

841
01:20:06,932 --> 01:20:07,766
Damn...

842
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:33,000
I thought he was just a pen-pusher.

843
01:20:34,626 --> 01:20:36,503
But he can fight.

844
01:20:41,091 --> 01:20:44,178
Internal calls could be bugged!

845
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:46,597
<i>Security code, please.</i>

846
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,182
Oh, come on!

847
01:20:48,265 --> 01:20:50,767
Uncle, Sugar, Oliver, Eight, Zero, Zero.

848
01:20:51,685 --> 01:20:55,147
<i>You're clear.
I'll put you through to the Colonel.</i>

849
01:20:59,067 --> 01:21:03,071
Damn it, Roy, pick up!
The Military is in trouble.

850
01:21:23,425 --> 01:21:24,676
Roy?

851
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:39,399
What do you want?

852
01:21:42,945 --> 01:21:46,740
We're to escort you
to East Area Headquarters.

853
01:21:51,078 --> 01:21:53,121
Is this an emergency?

854
01:21:56,792 --> 01:21:58,293
What's happening?

855
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:00,087
Ed...

856
01:22:03,674 --> 01:22:06,426
I'll let you know when I figure it out.

857
01:22:32,452 --> 01:22:35,831
Hey, stop pushing me!

858
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:41,003
Stand by until otherwise instructed, sir.

859
01:22:41,295 --> 01:22:42,212
Huh?

860
01:22:44,131 --> 01:22:46,258
It's like I'm a criminal...

861
01:22:47,467 --> 01:22:49,845
I won't use alchemy in here!

862
01:22:53,015 --> 01:22:54,558
They got you, too.

863
01:22:56,018 --> 01:22:57,352
Lieutenant.

864
01:22:59,313 --> 01:23:00,439
What's this about?

865
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,030
Captain Hughes...

866
01:23:10,324 --> 01:23:11,617
was murdered.

867
01:23:29,051 --> 01:23:31,428
This is part of the Military's dragnet.

868
01:23:34,515 --> 01:23:36,099
Who killed him?

869
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:46,443
Lieutenant!

870
01:23:50,405 --> 01:23:52,199
Colonel Mustang.

871
01:23:59,748 --> 01:24:01,750
There were witnesses.

872
01:24:18,559 --> 01:24:23,480
The Colonel's comrades
are being watched or detained.

873
01:24:29,194 --> 01:24:30,946
And also...

874
01:24:32,447 --> 01:24:34,408
Tucker is free.

875
01:24:36,368 --> 01:24:37,452
Alphonse!

876
01:24:37,953 --> 01:24:40,163
We're close to the truth!

877
01:24:40,998 --> 01:24:42,666
See you again!

878
01:24:44,793 --> 01:24:45,711
Al...

879
01:24:48,839 --> 01:24:49,965
No...!

880
01:24:50,966 --> 01:24:52,634
Mustang let Tucker out?

881
01:24:55,929 --> 01:24:57,139
Mustang...

882
01:24:58,932 --> 01:25:00,350
Where is he?

883
01:25:03,061 --> 01:25:04,688
Don't do it!

884
01:25:11,945 --> 01:25:13,030
Sorry.

885
01:25:16,116 --> 01:25:16,992
I got it.

886
01:25:19,703 --> 01:25:22,664
So, Mustang said,
"Laboratory Number 5"?

887
01:25:22,998 --> 01:25:27,711
Yes. He hung up on Hughes
and ran to the prisoner-of-war camp.

888
01:25:27,794 --> 01:25:31,298
But isn't Lab Number 5
at the old cannery?

889
01:25:31,882 --> 01:25:33,842
No, the Colonel said...

890
01:25:34,176 --> 01:25:37,679
that the researchers called the POW camp
"Lab Number 5."

891
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:49,107
Fall in!

892
01:25:51,193 --> 01:25:53,195
Secure the area!

893
01:26:10,045 --> 01:26:11,255
I knew it...

894
01:26:17,845 --> 01:26:20,556
Will you accompany me, Colonel?

895
01:26:21,974 --> 01:26:24,393
It's you, Lieutenant Ross...

896
01:26:25,394 --> 01:26:28,438
I'm taking you in
for Captain Hughes' murder.

897
01:26:30,148 --> 01:26:33,735
That's a lot of security
for a disused camp...

898
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:37,573
You knew I'd come here.

899
01:26:40,742 --> 01:26:41,910
Don't move.

900
01:26:45,247 --> 01:26:48,417
My order is to shoot to kill
if you resist.

901
01:26:52,421 --> 01:26:53,881
Colonel, don't!

902
01:27:02,431 --> 01:27:03,640
Don't do it!

903
01:27:48,769 --> 01:27:50,312
Why?

904
01:27:52,231 --> 01:27:53,524
Don't panic!

905
01:27:57,986 --> 01:28:00,322
This is damn hot.

906
01:28:22,678 --> 01:28:24,012
How did you know?

907
01:28:25,639 --> 01:28:29,518
Ross' mole is on her other cheek.

908
01:28:31,019 --> 01:28:32,020
Oh.

909
01:28:32,855 --> 01:28:34,189
Oops.

910
01:28:36,316 --> 01:28:38,193
Careless of me.

911
01:28:51,206 --> 01:28:54,209
I've been exposed, Lust.

912
01:28:55,252 --> 01:28:56,712
Yes.

913
01:28:57,546 --> 01:28:59,381
You have.

914
01:29:03,886 --> 01:29:06,471
Hey, I know you!

915
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:10,309
Thank you for remembering me...

916
01:29:12,227 --> 01:29:13,979
Fullmetal boy.

917
01:29:17,065 --> 01:29:19,193
The Ouroboros tattoo...

918
01:29:21,486 --> 01:29:22,404
Fullmetal.

919
01:29:22,905 --> 01:29:24,573
They're not humans.

920
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:26,736
They're Homunculi...

921
01:29:27,701 --> 01:29:30,746
The artificial humans.

922
01:29:32,664 --> 01:29:34,333
Homunculi?

923
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:40,255
You did your homework.

924
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:44,885
Do you know Maes Hughes?

925
01:29:45,969 --> 01:29:48,055
I know him very well.

926
01:29:49,598 --> 01:29:52,226
He was handsome and very smart.

927
01:29:53,268 --> 01:29:54,228
It's a shame...

928
01:29:55,562 --> 01:29:58,440
I didn't get to finish him off.

929
01:30:11,954 --> 01:30:15,332
<i>Hughes? What's wrong?</i>

930
01:30:15,999 --> 01:30:16,834
<i>Hello?</i>

931
01:30:20,128 --> 01:30:21,338
Who...

932
01:30:22,798 --> 01:30:23,966
are you?

933
01:30:31,723 --> 01:30:33,225
Nice touch, huh?

934
01:30:39,648 --> 01:30:41,942
<i>Hughes, what's going on?</i>

935
01:30:48,323 --> 01:30:50,659
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

936
01:30:51,285 --> 01:30:54,329
Go to Lab Number 5...

937
01:30:56,957 --> 01:31:00,419
It's the old prisoner-of-war camp...

938
01:31:00,502 --> 01:31:03,172
<i>Okay... Hughes!</i>

939
01:31:03,714 --> 01:31:04,840
<i>Hughes!</i>

940
01:31:06,049 --> 01:31:08,969
<i>Hang on! Hughes!</i>

941
01:31:10,929 --> 01:31:12,681
<i>Hughes!</i>

942
01:31:17,311 --> 01:31:21,982
I planned to frame you as a conspirator...

943
01:31:22,566 --> 01:31:24,860
and finish you off...

944
01:31:25,736 --> 01:31:27,404
like Captain Hughes.

945
01:31:30,699 --> 01:31:32,367
On your knees!

946
01:31:36,079 --> 01:31:38,540
I'll never kneel before you.

947
01:31:47,341 --> 01:31:48,884
You're merciless.

948
01:31:49,885 --> 01:31:53,055
A true Ishvalan Civil War hero!

949
01:32:05,103 --> 01:32:06,980
You helped Tucker escape!

950
01:32:09,696 --> 01:32:11,198
What's your agenda?

951
01:32:12,241 --> 01:32:13,408
Tucker...

952
01:32:15,035 --> 01:32:17,079
Who let out the professor?

953
01:32:18,914 --> 01:32:22,918
Maybe it was that tricky bastard...

954
01:32:23,836 --> 01:32:24,920
Envy!

955
01:32:33,011 --> 01:32:34,263
Gluttony.

956
01:32:34,888 --> 01:32:36,348
Eat them up...

957
01:32:37,558 --> 01:32:39,768
except Fullmetal boy.

958
01:32:43,188 --> 01:32:46,358
She said I could eat you all up.

959
01:32:46,942 --> 01:32:47,943
Open fire!

960
01:33:17,514 --> 01:33:18,348
Colonel!

961
01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:28,192
Even the Flame Colonel has a soft spot.

962
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:39,447
Fullmetal.

963
01:33:39,870 --> 01:33:41,663
Stop them.

964
01:33:42,998 --> 01:33:44,499
I'll be okay.

965
01:33:45,083 --> 01:33:46,376
Go after them!

966
01:34:46,061 --> 01:34:47,938
- Al!
- Don't come!

967
01:34:54,403 --> 01:34:56,196
Stop there!

968
01:34:59,324 --> 01:35:00,868
Come any closer...

969
01:35:04,872 --> 01:35:07,040
and I'll put a hole in her forehead.

970
01:35:08,166 --> 01:35:11,211
Sorry, Ed. I couldn't protect her.

971
01:35:13,005 --> 01:35:15,048
Tucker!

972
01:35:16,008 --> 01:35:19,136
I'll rip you apart for hurting them!

973
01:35:24,266 --> 01:35:26,268
I know you would.

974
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:31,398
First, remove your right arm.

975
01:35:31,982 --> 01:35:33,108
What?

976
01:35:34,693 --> 01:35:37,905
Your alchemy is too dangerous to ignore.

977
01:35:42,868 --> 01:35:43,744
But...

978
01:35:43,827 --> 01:35:45,579
Right now!

979
01:36:16,735 --> 01:36:19,279
I have to thank you.

980
01:36:19,655 --> 01:36:25,118
You taught me the secret
of embedding a soul in an object.

981
01:36:27,079 --> 01:36:28,121
Well...

982
01:36:29,414 --> 01:36:34,044
Actually, I guess it's your brother
I should thank.

983
01:36:36,588 --> 01:36:38,799
I asked him to take a peek inside...

984
01:36:39,842 --> 01:36:41,301
the Gate of Truth.

985
01:36:47,933 --> 01:36:49,726
So, you know the secret...

986
01:36:51,311 --> 01:36:52,479
Free them then.

987
01:37:01,029 --> 01:37:03,031
You know what this is?

988
01:37:06,201 --> 01:37:07,828
The Philosopher's Stone!

989
01:37:09,538 --> 01:37:11,164
That's right.

990
01:37:12,332 --> 01:37:14,001
This is it...

991
01:37:14,543 --> 01:37:19,298
The Philosopher's Stone you dreamed about.

992
01:37:24,303 --> 01:37:25,679
Have a look...

993
01:37:26,471 --> 01:37:28,015
At the floor.

994
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,284
This is to transmute the Stone...

995
01:37:49,077 --> 01:37:50,704
No...

996
01:37:52,956 --> 01:37:54,541
No!

997
01:37:58,337 --> 01:38:00,214
It's impossible!

998
01:38:05,093 --> 01:38:07,387
You really are a genius!

999
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:11,308
You know what this circle means.

1000
01:38:11,391 --> 01:38:14,186
- They didn't...
- They did!

1001
01:38:16,605 --> 01:38:19,441
They had the resources they needed.

1002
01:38:20,025 --> 01:38:24,071
Because this was a prisoner-of-war camp.

1003
01:38:26,365 --> 01:38:27,658
That's right.

1004
01:38:28,784 --> 01:38:30,953
The Stone's transmuted...

1005
01:38:33,830 --> 01:38:36,083
with living humans!

1006
01:39:32,181 --> 01:39:36,310
Marcoh and his team transmuted
all these Stones!

1007
01:39:45,194 --> 01:39:46,904
That's horrible...

1008
01:39:49,239 --> 01:39:51,742
You accused me of toying with lives.

1009
01:39:54,119 --> 01:39:57,915
Compared to this, I'm just tinkering!

1010
01:39:58,957 --> 01:39:59,917
See?

1011
01:40:00,876 --> 01:40:02,002
Right?

1012
01:40:02,961 --> 01:40:05,422
Fullmetal Alchemist!

1013
01:40:07,382 --> 01:40:08,842
Why?

1014
01:40:12,137 --> 01:40:14,556
Why did they do this?

1015
01:40:15,807 --> 01:40:17,684
I know.

1016
01:40:18,268 --> 01:40:20,687
So many of them! For what?

1017
01:40:24,358 --> 01:40:25,859
You see...

1018
01:40:27,778 --> 01:40:30,864
I have no interest in these pebbles.

1019
01:40:32,491 --> 01:40:33,408
It's just...

1020
01:40:34,451 --> 01:40:36,787
I have a personal desire.

1021
01:40:38,997 --> 01:40:43,877
I'd like you to fail
to fulfill your brilliant promise.

1022
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:48,048
Such a pleasure

1023
01:40:48,131 --> 01:40:52,719
could only be savored
by a superior man.

1024
01:40:54,388 --> 01:40:55,931
I'll make sure...

1025
01:40:56,598 --> 01:41:00,477
your miserable quest ends right here.

1026
01:41:16,368 --> 01:41:18,912
I hate mouthy guys.

1027
01:41:43,395 --> 01:41:46,273
This is not what I ordered you to do!

1028
01:41:50,736 --> 01:41:53,947
How long are you going to stare at me?

1029
01:41:54,573 --> 01:41:56,366
It's unsophisticated.

1030
01:42:10,005 --> 01:42:11,673
General Hakuro...

1031
01:42:12,424 --> 01:42:15,594
I showed you how to make
Philosopher's Stones...

1032
01:42:16,261 --> 01:42:19,139
but I won't show you how to use them.

1033
01:42:19,890 --> 01:42:21,058
Show me?

1034
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:23,685
There's no need.

1035
01:42:24,186 --> 01:42:27,648
The brilliant Mr. Tucker
solved the mystery.

1036
01:42:28,941 --> 01:42:30,817
Oh, really...

1037
01:42:32,569 --> 01:42:35,197
The State deemed him worthless...

1038
01:42:35,489 --> 01:42:38,534
but I was smart enough to know his value.

1039
01:42:42,162 --> 01:42:45,290
General, what's going on?

1040
01:42:47,209 --> 01:42:51,839
Do you know why the Military
prohibited Human Transmutation?

1041
01:42:52,464 --> 01:42:53,382
Sure.

1042
01:42:54,049 --> 01:42:56,593
Because it's unethical.

1043
01:42:57,386 --> 01:42:59,638
That's the official reason.

1044
01:43:00,931 --> 01:43:02,683
The real reason...

1045
01:43:02,766 --> 01:43:07,396
was to prevent
the transmutation of soldiers.

1046
01:43:08,063 --> 01:43:13,235
If it was allowed,
an individual could form a powerful army.

1047
01:43:16,613 --> 01:43:20,742
Let me show you
what the Military feared the most.

1048
01:43:42,931 --> 01:43:46,059
I doubt you can handle those babies.

1049
01:43:47,352 --> 01:43:49,188
I witnessed it all.

1050
01:43:49,771 --> 01:43:52,441
Mr. Tucker did a wonderful job.

1051
01:43:53,775 --> 01:43:55,819
What about you?

1052
01:43:55,903 --> 01:43:59,781
Did you plan to rule humans with them?

1053
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:04,244
Would you disobey your superiors?

1054
01:44:05,454 --> 01:44:08,957
I don't care which Military officials
you control.

1055
01:44:09,499 --> 01:44:11,627
No one gives me orders.

1056
01:44:12,628 --> 01:44:13,462
Now...

1057
01:44:14,004 --> 01:44:17,049
I'll drop each Stone in a tank...

1058
01:44:17,424 --> 01:44:20,010
and inject a soul in each dummy.

1059
01:44:20,594 --> 01:44:24,264
They feel no fear and no pain.

1060
01:44:24,348 --> 01:44:29,269
They'll become a powerful army
of invincible soldiers.

1061
01:44:30,437 --> 01:44:32,814
You selfish fool!

1062
01:44:33,565 --> 01:44:38,195
You sacrificed all those human lives
for your army!

1063
01:44:39,238 --> 01:44:40,781
I won't let you!

1064
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:22,090
With them I'll be King of the world!

1065
01:46:37,147 --> 01:46:39,441
Papa...

1066
01:46:40,108 --> 01:46:41,193
Yes.

1067
01:46:42,277 --> 01:46:44,363
I'm your daddy.

1068
01:46:47,407 --> 01:46:48,575
Papa.

1069
01:46:56,625 --> 01:47:00,087
Papa.

1070
01:47:01,463 --> 01:47:03,131
Papa.

1071
01:47:22,568 --> 01:47:25,988
What are we going to do
with these dummies?

1072
01:47:26,071 --> 01:47:28,490
He ruined our plan!

1073
01:47:31,952 --> 01:47:34,329
There's no end to humans' stupidity.

1074
01:47:41,545 --> 01:47:42,671
Gluttony!

1075
01:47:45,174 --> 01:47:47,009
Can I eat them?

1076
01:47:47,217 --> 01:47:48,051
Sure.

1077
01:47:50,762 --> 01:47:52,639
Leave no leftovers.

1078
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:04,610
Stop them!

1079
01:48:10,782 --> 01:48:12,534
Inform the soldiers outside.

1080
01:48:12,784 --> 01:48:15,370
Do not let them escape.

1081
01:48:16,079 --> 01:48:19,082
Or the public will be at risk!

1082
01:48:19,625 --> 01:48:20,876
But...

1083
01:48:24,213 --> 01:48:25,339
Their heads...

1084
01:48:28,926 --> 01:48:30,177
Get their heads.

1085
01:48:31,011 --> 01:48:31,845
Go!

1086
01:48:55,911 --> 01:48:56,995
I...

1087
01:48:57,412 --> 01:48:59,748
can't move my body.

1088
01:49:03,043 --> 01:49:04,169
Out of my way!

1089
01:49:09,424 --> 01:49:12,052
- Leave my brother alone!
- Ed!

1090
01:49:25,691 --> 01:49:28,735
Sorry, Ed. I messed up...

1091
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:30,737
You didn't!

1092
01:49:30,821 --> 01:49:31,655
Winry!

1093
01:49:34,324 --> 01:49:37,369
They took me hostage. So, Al had to...

1094
01:49:39,246 --> 01:49:40,330
Tell me later.

1095
01:49:40,414 --> 01:49:42,666
I'll go get the Homunculi.

1096
01:49:43,041 --> 01:49:45,460
Keep the dummies inside.

1097
01:49:45,544 --> 01:49:46,628
I'll try.

1098
01:49:47,254 --> 01:49:50,340
Put this on, just temporarily.

1099
01:49:53,635 --> 01:49:54,511
Okay!

1100
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:12,196
Damn you!

1101
01:50:12,738 --> 01:50:14,448
I'm angry now.

1102
01:50:17,910 --> 01:50:21,163
You won't get away with that!

1103
01:50:28,629 --> 01:50:33,342
You seared your wound to stop the blood.
How resourceful.

1104
01:50:34,635 --> 01:50:37,513
I almost fainted a few times doing it...

1105
01:50:38,347 --> 01:50:42,643
but I can't die until I get you all.

1106
01:50:44,019 --> 01:50:46,605
How many times do I have to stab you...

1107
01:50:47,356 --> 01:50:49,733
before you shut up and die?

1108
01:51:15,843 --> 01:51:18,887
She said no leftovers!

1109
01:51:23,016 --> 01:51:23,892
Load!

1110
01:51:27,813 --> 01:51:30,274
Shoot them in the head to kill them!

1111
01:51:30,899 --> 01:51:32,985
None of them leave!

1112
01:51:33,068 --> 01:51:33,902
Yes, ma'am!

1113
01:51:57,176 --> 01:51:58,051
Open fire!

1114
01:52:22,117 --> 01:52:24,912
This time I'll punch you with holes.

1115
01:52:26,413 --> 01:52:29,208
You'll have to sear everywhere.

1116
01:52:55,275 --> 01:52:57,986
Well done, Fullmetal boy.

1117
01:53:00,322 --> 01:53:03,200
As a reward, I'll reveal a secret.

1118
01:53:14,127 --> 01:53:15,754
We're man-made.

1119
01:53:16,338 --> 01:53:19,758
Our hearts are Philosopher's Stones.

1120
01:53:19,842 --> 01:53:24,304
You can kill us,
but the Stone's power brings us back.

1121
01:53:25,013 --> 01:53:26,598
You're immortal...

1122
01:53:29,768 --> 01:53:31,270
Monsters...

1123
01:53:32,813 --> 01:53:34,356
Don't be rude.

1124
01:53:35,315 --> 01:53:39,361
We look like you
and we have senses and feelings.

1125
01:53:39,695 --> 01:53:42,197
We have affection for our maker.

1126
01:53:45,450 --> 01:53:46,577
We're humans.

1127
01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:50,080
Damn it...

1128
01:53:51,415 --> 01:53:54,209
You burned me to death over and over.

1129
01:53:57,045 --> 01:53:59,464
But that's not enough to kill me.

1130
01:54:00,674 --> 01:54:04,136
You'd make an excellent sacrifice...

1131
01:54:04,678 --> 01:54:06,096
but, unfortunately...

1132
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:08,599
you have to die now.

1133
01:54:22,988 --> 01:54:23,906
Colonel.

1134
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:26,074
You noticed it, too?

1135
01:54:29,411 --> 01:54:33,582
The skinny one
is taking longer to recover.

1136
01:54:34,082 --> 01:54:38,253
The woman seems to be stalling for time.

1137
01:54:40,547 --> 01:54:42,257
"Not enough to kill you"?

1138
01:54:43,091 --> 01:54:47,596
Sounds like you have
a limited number of lives.

1139
01:54:50,265 --> 01:54:52,184
Your slow recovery...

1140
01:54:52,726 --> 01:54:55,854
implies that you're near your limit.

1141
01:55:00,317 --> 01:55:01,944
Am I right?

1142
01:55:02,486 --> 01:55:03,946
I guess this is it.

1143
01:55:04,988 --> 01:55:06,573
Your last life.

1144
01:56:12,139 --> 01:56:14,266
I won't go easy on you now.

1145
01:56:15,017 --> 01:56:16,018
Damn...

1146
01:56:19,438 --> 01:56:21,440
I'll take the boy with me.

1147
01:56:50,177 --> 01:56:52,596
So, you have a soft spot, too.

1148
01:56:56,558 --> 01:56:57,726
Eat this!

1149
01:57:10,405 --> 01:57:12,908
Now you're on your knees, Homunculus.

1150
01:57:17,538 --> 01:57:21,416
How many times do I have to burn you
before you shut up and die?

1151
01:57:25,838 --> 01:57:28,257
I'll kill you until you're dead for good!

1152
01:57:49,403 --> 01:57:51,280
This one's for Hughes!

1153
01:58:06,086 --> 01:58:07,796
<i>I can...</i>

1154
01:58:09,715 --> 01:58:11,675
<i>die...</i>

1155
01:58:14,178 --> 01:58:15,804
<i>Just like...</i>

1156
01:58:18,265 --> 01:58:20,058
<i>a human.</i>

1157
01:58:40,996 --> 01:58:41,914
Colonel.

1158
01:58:47,878 --> 01:58:49,505
Fullmetal...

1159
01:59:16,740 --> 01:59:19,201
Lust is dead...

1160
02:00:02,619 --> 02:00:03,745
Ed...

1161
02:00:04,329 --> 02:00:05,414
That's a...

1162
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:19,553
Yes.

1163
02:00:20,596 --> 02:00:22,556
The Philosopher's Stone.

1164
02:00:25,142 --> 02:00:27,769
We looked so hard for it.

1165
02:00:29,271 --> 02:00:30,647
The Stone.

1166
02:00:33,442 --> 02:00:34,776
It's ours now.

1167
02:00:41,533 --> 02:00:43,285
The damned thing...

1168
02:00:46,747 --> 02:00:48,957
I can't believe it!

1169
02:01:08,977 --> 02:01:10,020
Ed?

1170
02:01:12,189 --> 02:01:13,815
No, don't.

1171
02:01:14,316 --> 02:01:15,317
No!

1172
02:01:16,318 --> 02:01:18,570
It's a human soul!

1173
02:01:21,782 --> 02:01:22,616
Ed!

1174
02:01:32,042 --> 02:01:35,295
<i>It's been a long time, Alchemist.</i>

1175
02:01:42,928 --> 02:01:45,305
<i>You came back with the proper toll.</i>

1176
02:01:59,862 --> 02:02:01,029
Al...

1177
02:02:02,155 --> 02:02:04,032
Here you are...

1178
02:02:06,994 --> 02:02:08,871
You got so skinny.

1179
02:02:17,379 --> 02:02:18,547
<i>Now.</i>

1180
02:02:19,214 --> 02:02:20,883
<i>Let's trade.</i>

1181
02:02:44,406 --> 02:02:45,407
Al.

1182
02:02:46,366 --> 02:02:48,243
I'll come for you.

1183
02:02:49,244 --> 02:02:50,454
I promise.

1184
02:03:08,138 --> 02:03:10,933
Al!

1185
02:03:28,075 --> 02:03:29,117
<i>Ed.</i>

1186
02:03:30,827 --> 02:03:31,828
<i>Ed!</i>

1187
02:03:54,059 --> 02:03:55,018
Al.

1188
02:03:58,564 --> 02:03:59,648
I'm sorry.

1189
02:04:03,235 --> 02:04:04,611
I really am.

1190
02:04:09,575 --> 02:04:11,159
It's for the best.

1191
02:04:17,791 --> 02:04:20,502
If it's at the price of a life...

1192
02:04:21,211 --> 02:04:23,589
I'd rather stay like this.

1193
02:04:25,924 --> 02:04:26,842
Al...

1194
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:44,193
But, Al...

1195
02:04:47,196 --> 02:04:49,531
Your body was there.

1196
02:04:50,782 --> 02:04:52,034
It's really there.

1197
02:04:54,953 --> 02:04:57,206
I saw it.

1198
02:04:59,374 --> 02:05:00,834
It's there...

1199
02:05:02,127 --> 02:05:03,879
It really exists.

1200
02:05:06,673 --> 02:05:09,384
Did I look good?

1201
02:05:12,221 --> 02:05:13,096
Yes.

1202
02:05:15,432 --> 02:05:17,726
Your body has grown!

1203
02:05:20,187 --> 02:05:22,397
Am I taller than you?

1204
02:05:27,611 --> 02:05:28,445
Yes.

1205
02:05:30,656 --> 02:05:32,407
You're taller than me.

1206
02:05:34,201 --> 02:05:35,744
I am...

1207
02:05:36,954 --> 02:05:38,747
Aren't I great?

1208
02:06:16,618 --> 02:06:17,744
Colonel.

1209
02:06:19,037 --> 02:06:21,707
Make sure you rise to the top!

1210
02:06:22,791 --> 02:06:26,795
Get promoted and expose the truth
behind the mystery.

1211
02:06:28,297 --> 02:06:30,132
For Hughes' sake.

1212
02:06:33,594 --> 02:06:36,471
That was my intention.

1213
02:07:22,768 --> 02:07:26,188
Eeny, meeny, miny...

1214
02:07:27,272 --> 02:07:28,106
Moe!

1215
02:07:28,190 --> 02:07:29,525
Yeah!

1216
02:07:31,443 --> 02:07:32,653
Got you!

1217
02:07:33,237 --> 02:07:34,696
Oh, no!

1218
02:07:41,203 --> 02:07:43,330
<i>I'll get your body back...</i>

1219
02:07:44,039 --> 02:07:45,791
<i>I'll find another way...</i>

1220
02:07:47,417 --> 02:07:49,837
<i>to get your body back, Al!</i>
